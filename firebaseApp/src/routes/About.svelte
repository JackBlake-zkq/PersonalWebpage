        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm a rising sophomore at University of Wisconsin-Madison majoring in computer science. I plan on pursuing a career in mission driven web development.</p>
        <p>While I'm only just starting my journey as a developer, my favorite technologies to work with thus far have been serverless backend services like Firebase and Google Cloud Runs. In my current software engineering internship with Data Science for Sustainable Development, I've had the opportunity to help create a robust backend using the two. I've learned a lot already, and I'm excited to learn so much more!</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, you can usually find me on the golf course, playing Magic: The Gathering, or critically enjoying a movie.</p>
